Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that\u0027s just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!\t06 2, 2013\tAO94DHGC771SJ\tamazdnu\tGotta have GPS!\t1370131200\n0528881469\tWrappedArray(12, 15)\t1.0\tI\u0027m a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don\u0027t think I\u0027m all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13\u00276\"), the length (53\u0027) and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn\u0027t gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.\t11 25, 2010\tAMO214LNFCEI4\tAmazon Customer\tVery Disappointed\t1290643200\n0528881469\tWrappedArray(43, 45)\t3.0\tWell, what can I say.  I\u0027ve had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS \u0027s, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via\u0027s or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it\u0027s very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it\u0027s really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I\u0027ve noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I\u0027ve never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don\u0027t belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I\u0027d be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI\u0027s. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI\u0027sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I\u0027ll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.\t09 9, 2010\tA3N7T0DY83Y4IG\tC. A. Freeman\t1st impression\t1283990400\n0528881469\tWrappedArray(9, 10)\t2.0\tNot going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I\u0027ve driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they\u0027ll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn\u0027t make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I\u0027m sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn\u0027t make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12\u00276\" bridges when I\u0027m 13\u00276\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn\u0027t just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.\t11 24, 2010\tA1H8PY3QHMQQA0\tDave M.

It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it\u0027s a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I\u0027ve had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I\u0027d buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen.

It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV.

Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don\u0027t think I\u0027m all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13\u00276\"), the length (53\u0027) and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.

I\u0027ve had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS \u0027s, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via\u0027s or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it\u0027s very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it\u0027s really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I\u0027ve noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I\u0027ve never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don\u0027t belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I\u0027d be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI\u0027s. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI\u0027sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I\u0027ll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by

I checked around Amazon as well as some other sites, and decided these were what I needed.  I read the reviews, looked at the pictures and bought two of these.  I received them today.  I unpacked one of them, read the instructions and immediately filled out the return request for Amazon.  These mounts are very, very heavy and require 6, yes SIX, screws to mount to the wall.  Are you kidding me?  The TVs are only 22 lbs!  Two screws in the studs and then more damage to the wall than is necessary.  What a joke!  And Lag bolts?  Ever heard of screws?  The other issue is that these are very hard to move.  I bought an articulating wall mount for a reason, and I expect them to be able to move without a wrench in my hand.\tWrappedArray(what, a, piece, of, junk, i, checked, around, amazon, as, well, as, some, other, sites, and, decided, these, were, what, i, needed, i, read, the, reviews, looked, at, the, pictures, and, bought, two, of, these, i, received, them, today, i, unpacked, one, of, them, read, the, instructions, and, immediately, filled, out, the, return, request, for, amazon, these, mounts, are, very, very, heavy, and, require, 6, yes, six, screws, to, mount, to, the, wall, are, you, kidding, me, the, tvs, are, only, 22, lbs, two, screws, in, the, studs, and, then, more, damage, to, the, wall, than, is, necessary, what, a, joke, and, lag, bolts, ever, heard, of, screws, the, other, issue, is, that, these, are, very, hard, to, move, i, bought, an, articulating, wall, mount, for, a, reason, and, i, expect, them, to, be, able, to, move, without, a, wrench, in, my, hand)\n0972683275\tExcellent, at any price I mounted this in my RV and it holds a 26\" LCD TV / DVD combo.

Installation was easy...  The trouble I encountered was due to a bad wall stud finder.  Make sure you have one when you install this mount because you need to screw the mount into a wall stud or at least have one screw into a wall stud.The arm of the mount sags after I hooked up my 37in. LCD TV to the mount.  My TV is within the weight limit of this mount (less than 55lbs.) but the arm still sags due to the weight of the TV.  I guess as long as it supports my TV, the sagging shouldn\u0027t be an issue.  It just looks funny from the side.  I do retract the arm inward towards the wall to minimize the sagging and it also gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that the arm will be less likely to break off.Overall, for the price this mount is a great deal and works but I would suggest purchasing it for flat screen TVs less than 37 inches.  I would not hesitate to buy this mount again but for a 32 inch TV at most.\tWrappedArray(it, works, but, could, be, better, i, purchased, this, mount, for, my, 37, inch, lcd, tv, installation, was, easy, the, trouble, i, encountered, was, due, to, a, bad, wall, stud, finder, make, sure, you, have, one, when, you, install, this, mount, because, you, need, to, screw, the, mount, into, a, wall, stud, or, at, least, have, one, screw, into, a, wall, stud, the, arm, of, the, mount, sags, after, i, hooked, up, my, 37in, lcd, tv, to, the, mount, my, tv, is, within, the, weight, limit, of, this, mount, less, than, 55lbs, but, the, arm, still, sags, due, to, the, weight, of, the, tv, i, guess, as, long, as, it, supports, my, tv, the, sagging, shouldn, t, be, an, issue, it, just, looks, funny, from, the, side, i, do, retract, the, arm, inward, towards, the, wall, to, minimize, the, sagging, and, it, also, gives, me, the, warm, fuzzy, feeling, that, the, arm, will, be, less, likely, to, break, off, overall, for, the, price, this, mount, is, a, great, deal, and, works, but, i, would, suggest, purchasing, it, for, flat, screen, tvs, less, than, 37, inches, i, would, not, hesitate, to, buy, this, mount, again, but, for, a, 32, inch, tv, at, most)\n0972683275\tExcellent mount Do not listen to other reviewers, screws that this came with are concrete only, there are no wood or dry wall screws. You will!!!! need a stud finder!!! There are 8 holes in total on a mounting plate, so it is plenty enough if you hit the center of a stud. Sturdy,good looking. There is a whole set of machine screws for(my guess)all TV types plus couple of tools that you will need.\tWrappedArray(excellent, mount, do, not, listen, to, other, reviewers, screws, that, this, came, with, are, concrete, only, there, are, no, wood, or, dry, wall, screws, you, will, need, a, stud, finder, there, are, 8, holes, in, total, on, a, mounting, plate, so, it, is, plenty, enough, if, you, hit, the, center, of, a, stud, sturdy, good, looking, there, is, a, whole, set, of, machine, screws, for, my, guess, all, tv, types, plus, couple, of, tools, that, you, will, need)\n0972683275\tPoor Quality Control, May Block the Ports on Your TV Unfortunately, I\u0027m returning this mount.Though I like the look of it, particularly the two part plastic piece that clips to the wall mount portion to cover the bolts, I feel that the one I ordered wasn\u0027t well made.I purchased it to mount aLG 26LE5300 26-Inch 720p 60Hz LED LCD HDTVin our kitchen.The mount arrived quickly and was well packaged. Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I\u0027m glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren\u0027t recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they\u0027re situated rather high and central. Either way, it\u0027s something you\u0027ll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me. It\u0027s basically the same arm with a 75x75 to 100x100 VESA head on it. This second arm did not have any of the manufacturing errors of the previous model and fit the back of my tv perfectly.I understand that it\u0027s a very affordable mount, and that most of my issues may have been resolved with a replacement. However, I just can\u0027t give this mount any higher rating than I have.\tWrappedArray(poor, quality, control, may, block, the, ports, on, your, tv, unfortunately, i, m, returning, this, mount, though, i, like, the, look, of, it, particularly, the, two, part, plastic, piece, that, clips, to, the, wall, mount, portion, to, cover, the, bolts, i, feel, that, the, one, i, ordered, wasn, t, well, made, i, purchased, it, to, mount, alg, 26le5300, 26, inch, 720p, 60hz, led, lcd, hdtvin, our, kitchen, the, mount, arrived, quickly, and, was, well, packaged, unfortunately, the, arm, was, welded, to, the, wall, bracket, at, a, slight, angle, meaning, that, regardless, of, how, it, would, mount, it, and, the, lcd, would, never, be, level, also, the, powder, coating, near, one, of, the, bolts, had, come, off, and, i, could, see, some, rust, already, forming, i, decided, to, see, if, the, mount, would, be, the, right, fit, for, the, tv, before, returning, figuring, i, would, just, get, a, replacement, and, hope, for, the, best, i, m, glad, i, did, because, this, led, me, to, find, two, other, issues, the, first, one, i, blame, on, the, manufacturers, the, second, i, would, consider, a, design, flaw, of, the, lg, lcd, the, first, issue, is, that, the, screws, supplied, to, attach, the, bracket, to, the, tv, are, too, few, and, two, short, the, screws, are, only, 12mm, long, and, would, barely, catch, in, the, threads, of, the, tv, if, they, weren, t, recessed, at, all, most, mounting, threads, on, lcds, and, plasmas, are, partially, recessed, i, stopped, by, my, local, lowes, and, picked, up, two, packs, of, similar, screws, m4, 70, or, something, to, that, affect, 0, 80, a, packet, so, not, much, of, an, expenditure, just, a, big, hassle, i, needed, 20mm, long, screws, to, mount, this, to, the, tv, so, a, pretty, fair, difference, over, what, was, supplied, the, manufacturer, supplies, several, different, thread, and, gauge, options, but, only, one, shallow, length, of, each, set, the, second, issue, is, that, this, universal, mount, covered, the, power, and, hdmi, ports, on, the, back, of, the, 26le5300, again, i, think, this, is, more, of, an, issue, with, the, tv, then, the, mount, as, they, re, situated, rather, high, and, central, either, way, it, s, something, you, ll, want, to, check, on, your, tv, before, ordering, this, product, i, actually, returned, this, and, in, its, stead, purchased, a, similar, mount, from, the, same, company, thevideosecu, swing, lcd, wall, mount, 20, inch, extension, 55, lb, loading, capacity, for, lcd, tv, monitor, flat, screen, vesa, 75mm, 100, mm, 1usgets, very, high, marks, from, me, it, s, basically, the, same, arm, with, a, 75x75, to, 100x100, vesa, head, on, it, this, second, arm, did, not, have, any, of, the, manufacturing, errors, of, the, previous, model, and, fit, the, back, of, my, tv, perfectly, i, understand, that, it, s, a, very, affordable, mount, and, that, most, of, my, issues, may, have, been, resolved, with, a, replacement, however, i, just, can, t, give, this, mount, any, higher, rating, than, i, have)\n0972683275\tJunk, sags, wobbles, crooked, Rusted If less money had been spent on packaging and more on quality, it might be a good product.The product was double-boxed.  The included level was broken. I would prefer to use my own level and have good hardware instead of junk on both counts.  One of the pivots on the arm was so badly rusted out of the box it seemed to compromise the whole system.  Despite 6 huge lag screws and strong arms, the joints are not strong enough to keep the mount level as it extends and articulates.  Each time I moved it it had to be re-adjusted to be level.  The hardware had to be tightened so much to keep it from wobbling, it made moving it very difficult.

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn\u0027t want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn\u0027t be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn\u0027t have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn\u0027t use one  on a tablet so it doesn\u0027t bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well.

Not even for your enemies!\tI don\u0027t have a lot of money, so this was a major purchase for me a few years ago.  The only good thing I can say is that it actually does work, sort of.  It sync\u0027s parts of songs, adds the same song multiple times and all kinds of fun things.  I think I can honestly say that in all the time I have had it, I have not had one trouble free day with it or Itunes.  I HATE Apple and I will devote my life to destroying them.  Finally, I was able to \"fix\" my itunes, but it wouldn\u0027t allow me to add new music.  The drive is only half-full.  I finally gave it what it had coming all along.  Threw it as hard as I could into some rocks.  It\u0027s the only time that piece of crap ever gave me a bit of satisfaction.  I\u0027d rather have a no-name chinese knock off than this garbage.  Seriously, if you receive one as a gift, don\u0027t even open it.  Just put it in the circular file where it belongs.\t2\t19\t0.10526315789473684\t0.3563185666053984\nB001F7AHOG\tpiece of junk\tafter one year of use, I get the info \"your ipod is corrupted\", I tried everything I could and still cannot get it to work, (I tried different Pcs, macs, restoring it, etc), nothing helped and it is out of warranty, many people on the web claim to have same problem with it.\t1\t9\t0.1111111111111111\t0.3351814232929804\nB001F7AHOG\taEg - I didn\u0027t like it\tThis is a high quality product that will meet your needs. The seller was excellent. However, I\u0027v decided that I don\u0027t like \"i\" products or software. This is strictly my personal preference.\t1\t8\t0.125\t0.1778709651427161\nB001F7AHOG\tYou will hate Itunes.\tBought the Ipod Classic mp3 player with an incredible 160GB of memory. It was very nicely made, very high quality construction, very jewlery like. The main reason I returned it is due to having to use Itunes software. You will hate Itunes. I have an extensive library of albums in my computer in Windows Media Player ripped from my cd collection. Media Player automatically captures all album art and song list information from the internet without having to tell it to do so but, with Itunes you are forced to belong to the Itunes store and log in if you want album art even though you already have it in media player. Also, Itunes will force your computer to make duplicate copies of all the music you move over to it escentially doubling your hard disc space useage. I tunes broke apart all my nicely organized albums and loaded them as just random separate songs, making it impossable to find anything, let alone losing all the album art. If you are used to a Sandisk or something other than an Ipod that can use Media Player I think you will find Itunes really stupid. It is so backwards and forces you into registering with Itunes for everything so they can track what you have and send you advertisments. STAY AWAY FROM IPODS, ITUNES AND APPLE IN GENERAL, they want to control what you do!\t1\t8\t0.125\t0.28525701106421647\nB001F7AHOG\tAn Unevolved iPod\tThe new iPod classic is a huge disappointment with only one positive note. When Apple had their live music event last week, Apple should have trimmed the scroll wheel to the size of the nano\u0027s wheel, increased the screen size, or increase memory capacity beyond 160GB. Instead they failed to do everything that would improve the iPod classic. Yes, we now have a 160GB model as oppose to the 120GB model. However, the 160GB model was already released two years ago despite the fact that it was a bit on the bulkier side. On top of that, the black model still has that cheap AWFUL looking plastic casing on the top that seems to have been manufactured at a dollar store. The iPod is a decent MP3 player and its ease of use is great. But its flaw comes in the fact that its failed to EVOLVE properly. The Zune atleast has a huge 3.2 inch screen while the iPod size has remained the same. Another sad note is that Apple of course has gone ahead and poured all their creative ideas into the iPod Nano by giving them those great fashion colors and now they even have the luxury of a built in camcorder that records video in High Def from what i hear. The videos can also easily upload to Facebook or YouTube. Plus, the Nano now has a FM Radio.If Apple couldn\u0027t provide the Classic model with Fashion colors they could have at least given this so-called new model a built in camera/camcorder or the FM Radio. Apple, does this make any sense?Pros: Big memory for music lovers with an extensive music libraryBattery LifeCons: No evolution whatsoeverSmall Screen Size that has not changed in over 6 yearsNo camcorder/cameraCheap Plastic CoverNo Fashion ColorsNo radioNo wi-fiNo FM RadioNo customizable backgroundsMetal back still gets scratched easilyCheap ear phones etc\t85\t173\t0.4913294797687861\t0.3115904713021767\nB001F7AHOG\tBig things come in small packages...\tLet me start of saying that I didn\u0027t purchase this iPod on amazon, but I got it around 2 months ago at an Apple Store. Let me just say that this iPod is more than great, it is truly something amazing. With the most memory out of all other iPods and for its size, let me just say that big things can sometimes come in small packages. Now for the main review...\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d Storage \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dWith 160 GB of Storage, this its self should be a very good reason to get this iPod. It has a lot of memory! To give you an idea of how much 160 GB is, its 80 times as much as Apple\u0027s iPod Shuffle. All of that memory on to this small device. With 160 GB of memory you can have approximately 40,000 songs or 200 hours of video or 25,000 photos... That is a lot of memory! I have only used about 15 GB on my iPod and I can\u0027t really see me using up the entire storage. It is just that big!\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d Battery Life \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dWith this iPod you don\u0027t have to worry about having it run out of battery on you. It has an incredible 36 hours of battery life! That\u0027s 26 more hours than Apple\u0027s New iPad! You are going to enjoy having this iPod with that much storage and that much battery life. It\u0027s perfect for those long road trips or when you are going on a plane. It\u0027s small, convenient, tons of storage, and a very long lasting battery.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d The Display \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dThe display has a size of 2.5 inches. It\u0027s great for navigation through the iPod to find different songs, movies, or see slideshows of photos that you can transfer onto it. I personally find the screen being O.K., but other people say that it can be kind of small to watch movies and videos. considering the storage and the battery life I don\u0027t have a problem with the screen size. It is still great for watching movies whenever I get the urge to do so. As for finding specific songs or albums, the wheel makes it easy to do it. You can separate your music by albums, genre, etc. It makes it easy to find the music that you want to listen to. Most of the time though, I leave mine on shuffle. Shuffle generates random songs for a different choice of music.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d Genius \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dIf you have tons of songs on your iPod then Genius is going to come in handy. If you really like the song that you are listening to, simply turn Genius on and it will find other similar songs on the iPod to the one that you are listening to. You can also create Genius Mixes that you can listen to in the future.\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d Durability \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003dThe iPod is very sturdy and it looks very strong. This iPod has fallen about twice and it hit straight concrete from about 4 feet and it survived. It did get a couple of scratches, but everything still works perfectly. Unlike the iPod Touch this iPod is definitely stronger and it will sustain more damage. I am not saying to go drop your iPod everywhere you go. I am just saying this is more durable than iPods that have a fragile screen/body.Overall: This is a really great iPod that is not that expensive considering what you get out of it. I recommend this iPod for all those people that really love music and movies. You will no longer have to leave out your music because it will all fit on this iPod\u0027s storage! I rate this iPod 5 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review helped you out!\t6\t6\t1.0\t0.9575447518017256\n"

I tried and tried and tried to hone in the sound I was looking for but the Boss just wouldn\u0027t do it for me. Fast forward a few years and I purchase this little baby on a whim. Man, am I glad I did. The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for. A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom-end than it could ever manage on its own, and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced, well-rounded sound. Love it and wouldn\u0027t wanna part with it.The pedal itself is built like a rock. I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing. The individual sliders, although not quite as Ford-tough as the rest of the pedal (haha), feel nice and slide easy. Each slider lights up red when engaged, which not only looks cool but makes it very easy to see on a dimly lit stage.If you\u0027re on the fence about an EQ or which EQ brand to buy, I recommend you give this little monster a stomp\"),\n  (\"This is a short summary\",\"This product sucks\"),\n  (\"This is a good product\",\"I liked this product very much.

Man, am I glad I did. The 6 sliders made it very easy to dial in the exact tone I was looking for. A small boost of the first two sliders gave my amp more bottom-end than it could ever manage on its own, and a small boost of the last two provided more of a balanced, well-rounded sound. Love it and wouldn\u0027t wanna part with it.The pedal itself is built like a rock. I imagine nothing shy of nuclear war could dent this thing. The individual sliders, although not quite as Ford-tough as the rest of the pedal (haha), feel nice and slide easy.
